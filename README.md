# Features
- Navigation
  - At the top of all 3 pages we find the navigationbar identical on each page.<br> all 3 links on the nav-bar is centered and to the most left we find "home" link, home takes us to the main page (index), in the middle we find the 
   "Lifehacks" link that takes us to the second page where we find the majority of information and to the left we find the "about us" link.<br>

  - The navigation bar is in a dark gray color with white text, originally the text was a lighter gray color, but to score higher on the lighthouse accessebillity score I had to contrast it "harder" and did that using a white text-color.
  - The navigation bar is easy to find and clearly tells the user what each link is for.

- the header
  - The header is a simple yet effective header in the font times new roman.
  - There is allso a smaller header bellow the nav-bar "Your everyday lifehack handbook" and was originally planed to match the theme of the page with a book-paper color on the body background color, this again was scraped to amuse the Lighthuse rankings...
  - The header clearly tells the user what the site is for.<br>

## Testing
- I tested that all 3 pages works in Chrome, safari and Firefox

- I have looked and confirmed that the pages look good on different devices

- I have looked and confiormed that the nav-bar, header, about us and lifehack pages are readable and understanable.

- I have confirmed that the sign up section "works" (even doh I dont have a server to send the data too) but it will only accept email in the email form, hide the password forms with stars *****. and the radio buttons makes it impossible to select "yes" and "no" at the same time on the "newletter" option.

## Bugs

- fixed smaller buggs like missing spacebars before elements.
- Fixed bugg where "br" was not allowed as child-element in "ol", Br was used to make the strucure of "li". and are now removed, leaving the page looking messy. But my understanding is that using "br" in "ol" is bad when using resposive design, and I have learned my lesson.
- Fixed bugg where "alt" attributes was not allowed in "iframe" element, or in socialmedia links att the bottom.
- fixed bug where titel was not allowed in "iframe"
