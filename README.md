# Features
- Navigation
  - At the top of all 3 pages we find the navigationbar identical on each page.<br> all 3 links on the nav-bar is centered and to the most left we find "home" link, home takes us to the main page (index), in the middle we find the 
   "Lifehacks" link that takes us to the second page where we find the majority of information and to the left we find the "about us" link.<br>

  - The navigation bar is in a dark gray color with white text, originally the text was a lighter gray color, but to score higher on the lighthouse accessebillity score I had to contrast it "harder" and did that using a white text-color.
  - The navigation bar is easy to find and clearly tells the user what each link is for.

- the header
  - The header is a simple yet effective header in the font times new roman.
  - There is allso a smaller header bellow the nav-bar "Your everyday lifehack handbook" and was originally planed to match the theme of the page with a book-paper color on the body background color, this again was scraped to amuse the Lighthuse rankings...
  - The header clearly tells the user what the site is for.<br>
