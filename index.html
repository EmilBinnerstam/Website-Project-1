        <li> Stench-free floors! Put old Newspaper at the bottom of your trash bin to prevent it from leaking Junk-juice!</li>
        <li>Fog-Free Mirrors! Prevent your bathroom mirror from fogging up after a hot shower with car wax.
             Apply a small amount of car wax to the mirror, let it dry, then buff with a soft, dry cloth.</li>
        <li>Get Wrinkles Out of Your Laundry with Zero Effort! Ditch the time-consuming iron or handheld steamer to get wrinkles out of a shirt or slacks.
             Throw a few ice cubes or a wet washcloth in the dryer with your wrinkled clothes.
             As the ice melts and the water turns to steam, it will remove the wrinkles.
              This trick isn’t as effective with heavier clothing but is a miracle for lighter fabrics.
              The best part is that you don’t have to set the dryer for longer than 10 minutes for it to work. </li>
        <li>Zip-Tie Phone Stand! When referencing projects plans or a photo for inspiration while working on a DIY project,
             most of us use our phones to display images or instructional videos. The only problem with this method is that our phones don’t prop themselves up,
              making it difficult to see at the images while working. You can make a smartphone stand out of just about anything these days,
               but it doesn’t get much simpler than looping zip ties around your phone
               (1 on each side). All you have to do is tighten the zip ties until they are snug to the phone with the zip-tie heads facing down and near the edge of your phone.
                Now you can watch video instructions or look at project drawings without having to hold it in your hands the whole time.</li>
        <li>How to Double Your Resealable Bags! This might be the coolest way to turn sandwich-size bags into snack-size bags! Here’s how to do it:
         Heat up an old butter knife with a lighter and slice the bag in half. The hot knife cauterizes the edges of the two new bags. The cauterized edges are as strong as the factory sealed edges!
