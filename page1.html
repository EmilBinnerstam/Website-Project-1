    <li>We’re sure you’re stocking up on sweet smelling candles to make your home extra cozy for the colder months. But, if your candles are burning too low to reach the wick, there’s no reason to go without your favorite scent. 
        Instead of burning your fingers, light a piece of uncooked spaghetti.
         It’ll reach into those deep candles and burn long enough to light the candles on grandpa’s birthday cake!</li><br>

                <li>Ever wish you could remove highlighter marks from a book? Lemon juice fades highlighter enough to make it virtually undetectable. Cut a lemon in half and get some juice on a cotton swab. 
                 Run the swab over the highlighted text and watch the color fade.</li><br>

                <li>My puppy was eating his food too fast, resulting in him vomiting it back up. Instead of buying a slow-feed bowl, I<br> drilled holes into a 12 in.
                length of 2 in. PVC pipe and capped the ends. I fill the tube with puppy <br>food, and he has to roll it around to get the food to fall out of the holes. 
                 My puppy gets all the food he needs without the mess <br>that comes from eating too fast. Be sure the holes are large enough for the food to come out! – Charlie May</li><br>

                 <li>It seems the older I get, the more keys I carry around.<br> Between the car, house, shed and garage, I have a whole pocket full of keys. 
                To make it easier to quickly find my most used keys,<br> I paint both sides of the key head with brightly colored nail polish.
                 I use a different color for each key.<br> The nail polish is extremely durable and you’ll be surprised how much longer it lasts than spray paint.</li><br>
